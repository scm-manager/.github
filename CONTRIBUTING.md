# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

All members of the project community must abide by the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.0](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Only by respecting each other we can develop a productive, collaborative community.
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting [SCM-Manager Team](mailto:scm-team@cloudogu.com) and/or a project maintainer.

Issues which are not related to the project itself will be closed by our community managers.

## Engaging in Our Project

We use GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you are a new contributor, see: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute)

* If you plan to do something more involved, please reach out to us and send an [email](mailto:scm-team@cloudogu.com). This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal of inspiration.

## Steps to Contribute

Should you wish to work on an issue that has not yet been claimed, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on and begin work (the maintainers will assign it to your GitHub user as soon as they can). This is to prevent duplicated efforts from other contributors on the same issue.

If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them, and one of the maintainers will clarify.

We kindly ask you to follow the [Pull Request Checklist](#Pull-Request-Checklist) to ensure reviews can happen accordingly.

## Contributing Code

You are welcome to contribute code in order to fix a bug or to implement a new feature.

## Contributing Documentation

You are welcome to contribute documentation to the project.
Contributions must be licensed under the same license as code, the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt)

## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the develop branch and, if needed, rebase to the current develop branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with develop, you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* Make sure each new source file you add has a correct license header. A missing license header will break your build.

* Add automated unit-/ or integration tests. If tested manually, provide information about the test scope in the PR description (e.g. “Test passed: Upgrade version from 0.42 to 0.42.23.”).

* Post review:
  * If a review requires you to change your commit(s), please test the changes again.
  * Amend the affected commit(s) and force push onto your branch.
  * Set respective comments in your GitHub review to resolved.
  * Create a general PR comment to notify the reviewers that your amendments are ready for another round of review.

## Issues and Planning

* We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests.

* Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to reproduce that issue for the assignee. Therefore, contributors should use but aren't restricted to the issue template provided by the project maintainers.

* When creating an issue, try using one of our issue templates which already contain some guidelines on which content is expected to process the issue most efficiently.
